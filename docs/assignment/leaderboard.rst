Submission and Leaderboard
==========================

On this page, you will see the performance ranking of your algorithm updated Tuesday, Friday starting from April 14th, which is calculated with the latest files you upload to Moodle.
For privacy, we will show your nickname here, which will be defined by the zip file name of your submission.
Do not share your code with others, we are checking your code for similarities.

Please ensure that the zip file you submit at least contains your **my_assignment.py** and **ex1_pid_control.py** file. We will only evaluate those files as the other files should be the same for all submissions to ensure fairness in the evaluation process.

**Note**:

- Your code will be evaluated on three randomly generated environments
- Please save your code before the submission deadline on Moodle to avoid any potential last-minute system crashes
- Simulation code submission deadline is **April 28th at 23:59**
